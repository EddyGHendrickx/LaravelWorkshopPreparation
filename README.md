# LaravelWorkshopPreparation

Welcome to our Laravel workshop.
Laravel is based on Symfony, so 
a basic understanding/knowledge of symfony/php 
will help a lot for following the workshop. 

## MUST INSTALL

Make sure you have composer installed. A new
laravel project can be made from scratch by just having 
the composer. This can be done by running:
'composer new-project laravel/laravel [name-of-project]'

### OPTIONAL

Installing laravel globally is also an option, but
a bit more challenging.

#### CONTENTS

We're going to make a pokémon game in which you can catch
and collect all kinds of pokémon, sell them in the store and
much more...
